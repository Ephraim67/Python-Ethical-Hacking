# Python for Ethical Hacking - Beginner's Guide

## 1. Introduction to Python for Ethical Hacking
Python is widely used in cybersecurity due to its simplicity and powerful libraries. In this guide, weâ€™ll cover the fundamental Python concepts that are essential for ethical hacking.

## 2. Python Basics
Before diving into hacking, you should be comfortable with the following concepts:

### 2.1 Variables and Data Types
Variables store data values. Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, and lists.
```python
x = 10  # Integer
y = 3.14  # Float
name = "Hacker"  # String
is_active = True  # Boolean
```

### 2.2 Loops (For & While)
Loops allow execution of a block of code multiple times.
```python
# For loop
for i in range(5):
    print("Iteration:", i)

# While loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

### 2.3 Conditional Statements (If-Else)
Conditionals control the flow of execution based on conditions.
```python
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Access granted")
else:
    print("Access denied")
```

### 2.4 Functions and Modules
Functions allow code reusability, and modules enable additional functionalities.
```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

print(greet("Hacker"))
```
Importing built-in modules:
```python
import os
print(os.name)
```

## 3. File Handling
Reading and writing files is crucial for log analysis and data storage.
```python
# Writing to a file
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("This is a test file.")

# Reading from a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

## 4. Networking with Sockets
The `socket` module helps in network communications, such as scanning open ports.
```python
import socket

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(("example.com", 80))
s.send(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n")
response = s.recv(1024)
print(response.decode())
s.close()
```

## 5. Regular Expressions (Regex) for Pattern Matching
Regex is used for extracting and validating data (e.g., finding emails in text).
```python
import re

text = "Contact me at hacker@example.com"
pattern = r"[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+"
match = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Found emails:", match)
```

## 6. Hands-On Exercises
1. **Create a script that scans open ports on a given IP.**
2. **Write a program to extract all URLs from a webpage.**
3. **Develop a keylogger (for legal educational purposes only).**
