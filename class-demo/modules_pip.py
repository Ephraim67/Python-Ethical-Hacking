# Python modules
"""
When you install Python, you also install its set of standard libraries and modules that provide you with 
an extensive range of capabilities. These include built-in data types, exception handling, numeric and 
math modules, file handling, cryptographic services (critical to hacker and information security pros), 
internet data handling, and interaction with internet protocols.

Despite all the power offered by these standard libraries and modules, you may need additional third
party modules. In Python, third-party modules are extensive and one of the primary reasons hackers 
prefer Python to other programming languages. You can find a comprehensive list of third party-modules 
at PyPI (the Python Package Index, shown below)

# Pip
"""Python has its own package manager (like rpm or apt) specifically for installing and managing Python 
packages known as pip (Python Installs Packages)."""


#  Object-Oriented Programming
"""OOP revolves 
around the concept of an object. The object has properties in the form of attributes and states, as well as 
methods that are actions performed by or on the object."""

"""
           |---Property (Attribute or state)
Object ==> |
           |---Method (Do something function & Procedure)

Objects then are members of a class, which is like a template for creating objects with shared initial 
variables, properties, and methods. For example, if we have a class called cars, our car (Audi) would be a 
member of the class of cars. This class would also include other objects/cars, such as Toyota and BMW.

Classes can also have subclasses. Our car class has an Audi subclass, and an object of that subclass might 
be an Audi A8.
Each object would have properties (make, model, year, and color) and methods (start, lock, drive, and 
park).
In OOP languages such as Python, objects inherit the characteristics of their class; the AudiA8 would 
inherit the methods (start, lock, drive, and park) from its class “car.”
 These OOP concepts are critical to understanding how Python works, as you will see as you progress 
through this chapter, and your Python skills develop.
