# Python Try Except
# Handling exceptions
# The 'try' block lets you test a block of code for errors
# The 'except' block lets you handle the error
# The 'else' block lets you execute code when there is no error
# The 'finally' block lets you execute code regardless of the result of the try-except block

# Example of try except
try:
    print(x) # This will cause an error because x is not defined
except:
    print("An error occurred") # This will be executed if there is an error


# Many exceptions
try:
    print(x)
except NameError:
    print("Variable x is not defined")
except:
    print("Somthing else went wrong")

# Else statement
# Else is executed when there is no error
try:
    print("Hello")
except:
    print("An error occurred")
else:
    print("No error occurred")

# Finally statement
# The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an error occurred or not
try:
    print(x)
except:
    print("An error occurred")
finally:
    print("x will not always executed as long as it's not defined.")

# Practicalizing everything
# We will create a file that is not writable and try to mofify it.
try:
    f = open("demo.txt", "r") # Open a file in read mode
    f = open("demo.txt", "w") # Open a file in write mode
    try:
        f.write("Hello world")
    except:
        print("Something went wrong when editing this file.")
    finally:
        f.close()
except:
    print("File not found")

finally:
    print("Any file that does not have write permission will not be able to be modified.")

# If condiitional statement
# If statement is used to check a condition
# If the condition is true, the code inside the if block will be executed
# If the condition is false, the code inside the else block will be executed
