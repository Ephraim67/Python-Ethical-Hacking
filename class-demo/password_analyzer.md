##  Password Strength Analyzer

### Task Objective:
Create a program that analyzes password strength by checking for common security vulnerabilities.

### Concepts Used:
- **Variables** - Store password criteria
- **Strings** - Analyze password content
- **For Loop** - Iterate through password characters
- **Function** - Encapsulate the analysis logic



### Learning Objectives:

1. **Variables**: Understand how to store and track multiple conditions
2. **Strings**: Learn string methods (`isupper()`, `islower()`, `isdigit()`) and membership testing
3. **For Loop**: Practice iterating through each character in a string
4. **Function**: Create reusable code blocks for specific tasks



### Real-World Cybersecurity Connection:
- This mimics how security systems evaluate password strength
- Teaches students about common password vulnerabilities
- Demonstrates why complex passwords are important for security
